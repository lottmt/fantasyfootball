  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>Kyle dreamt of playing in an elite fantasy football league since he was a child 65 million years ago.
    That dream became a reality in 2018 when he became an inagural member of the BCYB4UWU.
    He finished the season with a 12-1-0 record and the "Grey Cutoff Hoodie" trophy.
    Kyle also took home the Asshole of the Year Award for the 2018-2019 season.
    He is the all-time winningest coach in league history. Will he continue his streak of success in year 2?</p>
